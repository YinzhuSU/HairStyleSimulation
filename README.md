# GrabCutIOS
Image segmentation using GrabCut algorithm in IOS 

## Overview
GrabCut is an image segmentation method based on graph cuts. The algorithm was designed by Carsten Rother, Vladimir Kolmogorov & Andrew Blake from Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK. in their paper, "GrabCut": interactive foreground extraction using iterated graph cuts . An algorithm was needed for foreground extraction with minimal user interaction, and the result was GrabCut.

## Requirement
1. OpenCV Framework

## Usage
1. Import GrabCutManager
```objectiveC
#import "GrabCutManager.h"
GrabCutManager* grabcut = [[GrabCutManager alloc] init];
```

2. Set foreground boundary with a rect.
```objectiveC
-(UIImage*) doGrabCut:(UIImage*)sourceImage foregroundBound:(CGRect) rect iterationCount:(int)iterCount;
```
```objectiveC
-(void) doGrabcut{
    __weak typeof(self)weakSelf = self;
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT,
                                             (unsigned long)NULL), ^(void) {
        UIImage* resultImage= [weakSelf.grabcut doGrabCut:weakSelf.resizedImage foregroundBound:weakSelf.grabRect iterationCount:5];
        resultImage = [weakSelf masking:weakSelf.originalImage mask:[weakSelf resizeImage:resultImage size:weakSelf.originalImage.size]];        
        dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^(void) {
            [weakSelf.resultImageView setImage:resultImage];
        });
    });
}
```

3. Make masking image with the adding or removing parts from result.
```objectiveC
-(UIImage*) doGrabCutWithMask:(UIImage*)sourceImage maskImage:(UIImage*)maskImage iterationCount:(int) iterCount;
```
```objectiveC
-(void) doGrabcutWithMaskImage:(UIImage*)image{
    __weak typeof(self)weakSelf = self;    
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT,
                                             (unsigned long)NULL), ^(void) {
        UIImage* resultImage= [weakSelf.grabcut doGrabCutWithMask:weakSelf.resizedImage maskImage:[weakSelf resizeImage:image size:weakSelf.resizedImage.size] iterationCount:5];
        resultImage = [weakSelf masking:weakSelf.originalImage mask:[weakSelf resizeImage:resultImage size:weakSelf.originalImage.size]];
        dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^(void) {
            [weakSelf.resultImageView setImage:resultImage];
        });
    });
}
```

## Limitation
This program use OpenCV library.
It is not use GPU in IOS. it is obviously more slower than library that it use GPU.
So I want to improve this code to use GPU like GPUImage.

This algorithm is based on color value distribution. 
There is a limitation when foreground and background color are similar.
